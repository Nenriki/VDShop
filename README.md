## Usage

Inside the software, you can see your previous daily shop historic if you have used it before, or have added an old save.  
By clicking the **'+'** button (Don't forget to fill the right date before) a new widget will appear, with all four items to create.  
Choose the *Weapon* and the *Collection*  (The color of the Valorant logo will change according of the existence of the combinaison you choose (green = valid ; Red = invalid)). Then you can click on the *'Confirm'* button.  
Once all the four items are confirmed, the line will be automatically saved.  

On the bottom right corner, there is a button to **quit** the software.  
You can toggle fullscreen and windowed mode by pressing ***F11***.
